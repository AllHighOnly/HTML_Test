# HTML_Test
This is a example HTML, made by me to test my HTML skills.

It just contains some simple coding, nothing to big. If you have any suggestions to improve it, message me ;)

NEW RELEASE:
- V0.0.2: Some new minor visual changes
- V0.0.1: Added a "Go back" button on every page which leads you back to the index page
